This is the README for the AUDIOENTROPY program created for our CPSC 530 research course.

This program may easily be compiled and run using the Eclipse IDE. The main function is
located in the "Collector" class. Thus, the program may also be compiled by compiling
each class using "javac" before running the "Collector" class using the "java" command.

Once the program is run, the following 5 seconds of audio are recorded and used according
to the experiment specifications.  Note that the data line parameters in the "AudioCapture"
class may need to be altered in order to run the program on different machines. The results
of the statistical randomness tests are then printed to the standard output.
